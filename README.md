# c-asip

This is the plain C client for the asip protocol. See [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366416300743) for the theoretical background.

**IMPORTANT**: only Linux and Mac clients are supported (currently tested on Linux x64, Mac 10.13, Raspberry Pi with standard Raspbian). Tested on Arduino Uno and Teensy 3.2

## Installation and usage

* First of all, install the ASIP firmware on the microcontroller, as explained here: https://github.com/mdxmase/asip
